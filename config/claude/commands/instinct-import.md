# Instinct Import Command

## Implementation

Run the instinct CLI using the plugin root path:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/continuous-learning-v2/scripts/instinct-cli.py" import <file-or-url> [--dry-run] [--force] [--min-confidence 0.7]
```

Or if `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is not set (manual installation):

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/continuous-learning-v2/scripts/instinct-cli.py import <file-or-url>
```

Import instincts from:
- Teammates' exports
- Skill Creator (repo analysis)
- Community collections
- Previous machine backups

## Usage

```
/instinct-import team-instincts.yaml
/instinct-import https://github.com/org/repo/instincts.yaml
/instinct-import --from-skill-creator acme/webapp
```

## What to Do

1. Fetch the instinct file (local path or URL)
2. Parse and validate the format
3. Check for duplicates with existing instincts
4. Merge or add new instincts
5. Save to `~/.claude/homunculus/instincts/inherited/`

## Import Process

```
📥 Importing instincts from: team-instincts.yaml
================================================

Found 12 instincts to import.

Analyzing conflicts...

## New Instincts (8)
These will be added:
  ✓ use-zod-validation (confidence: 0.7)
  ✓ prefer-named-exports (confidence: 0.65)
  ✓ test-async-functions (confidence: 0.8)
  ...

## Duplicate Instincts (3)
Already have similar instincts:
  ⚠️ prefer-functional-style
     Local: 0.8 confidence, 12 observations
     Import: 0.7 confidence
     → Keep local (higher confidence)

  ⚠️ test-first-workflow
     Local: 0.75 confidence
     Import: 0.9 confidence
     → Update to import (higher confidence)

## Conflicting Instincts (1)
These contradict local instincts:
  ❌ use-classes-for-services
     Conflicts with: avoid-classes
     → Skip (requires manual resolution)

---
Import 8 new, update 1, skip 3?
```

## Merge Strategies

### For Duplicates
When importing an instinct that matches an existing one:
- **Higher confidence wins**: Keep the one with higher confidence
- **Merge evidence**: Combine observation counts
- **Update timestamp**: Mark as recently validated

### For Conflicts
When importing an instinct that contradicts an existing one:
- **Skip by default**: Don't import conflicting instincts
- **Flag for review**: Mark both as needing attention
- **Manual resolution**: User decides which to keep

## Source Tracking

Imported instincts are marked with:
```yaml
source: "inherited"
imported_from: "team-instincts.yaml"
imported_at: "2025-01-22T10:30:00Z"
original_source: "session-observation"  # or "repo-analysis"
```

## Skill Creator Integration

When importing from Skill Creator:

```
/instinct-import --from-skill-creator acme/webapp
```

This fetches instincts generated from repo analysis:
- Source: `repo-analysis`
- Higher initial confidence (0.7+)
- Linked to source repository

## Flags

- `--dry-run`: Preview without importing
- `--force`: Import even if conflicts exist
- `--merge-strategy <higher|local|import>`: How to handle duplicates
- `--from-skill-creator <owner/repo>`: Import from Skill Creator analysis
- `--min-confidence <n>`: Only import instincts above threshold

## Output

After import:
```
✅ Import complete!

Added: 8 instincts
Updated: 1 instinct
Skipped: 3 instincts (2 duplicates, 1 conflict)

New instincts saved to: ~/.claude/homunculus/instincts/inherited/

Run /instinct-status to see all instincts.
```

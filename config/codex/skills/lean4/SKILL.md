# Lean 4 Theorem Proving

Use this skill whenever you're editing Lean 4 proofs, debugging Lean builds, formalizing mathematics in Lean, or learning Lean 4 concepts. It prioritizes LSP-based inspection and mathlib search, with scripted primitives for sorry analysis, axiom checking, and error parsing.

## Core Principles

**Search before prove.** Many mathematical facts already exist in mathlib. Search exhaustively before writing tactics.

**Build incrementally.** Lean's type checker is your test suite—if it compiles with no sorries and standard axioms only, the proof is sound.

**Respect scope.** Follow the user's preference: fill one sorry, its transitive dependencies, all sorries in a file, or everything. Ask if unclear.

**Use 100-character line width for Lean files.** Do not wrap lines at 80 characters — Lean and mathlib convention is 100. If a line fits within 100 characters, keep it on one line. See [mathlib-style](references/mathlib-style.md) for breaking strategies when lines exceed 100.

**Never change statements or add axioms without explicit permission.** Theorem/lemma statements, type signatures, and docstrings are off-limits unless the user requests changes. Inline comments may be adjusted; docstrings may not (they're part of the API). Custom axioms require explicit approval—if a proof seems to need one, stop and discuss. Exception: within synthesis wrappers (`/lean4:formalize`, `/lean4:autoformalize`), session-generated declarations may be redrafted under the outer-loop statement-safety rules; see cycle-engine.md.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/lean4:draft` | Draft Lean declaration skeletons from informal claims |
| `/lean4:formalize` | Interactive formalization — drafting plus guided proving |
| `/lean4:autoformalize` | Autonomous end-to-end formalization from informal sources |
| `/lean4:prove` | Guided cycle-by-cycle theorem proving with explicit checkpoints |
| `/lean4:autoprove` | Autonomous multi-cycle theorem proving with explicit stop budgets |
| `/lean4:checkpoint` | Save progress with a safe commit checkpoint |
| `/lean4:review` | Read-only code review of Lean proofs |
| `/lean4:refactor` | Leverage mathlib, extract helpers, simplify proof strategies |
| `/lean4:golf` | Improve Lean proofs for directness, clarity, performance, and brevity |
| `/lean4:learn` | Interactive teaching and mathlib exploration |
| `/lean4:doctor` | Diagnostics, cleanup, and migration help |

This plugin ships a host-agnostic parser (`lib/command_args/`) that covers the
parser-decidable startup rules of the six parameter-heavy commands (`draft`,
`learn`, `formalize`, `autoformalize`, `prove`, `autoprove`). A small set of
documented startup rules in these commands depend on runtime context (repo-
level search, interactive prompting) and are applied by the command after
reading the parser's output. The other commands (`checkpoint`, `review`,
`refactor`, `golf`, `doctor`) remain model-parsed.
When a host adapter installs the `UserPromptSubmit` hook, the parser runs
before the model sees a `/lean4:*` prompt matching one of the six covered
commands, injects a `validated-invocation` block into context, and rejects
invalid invocations at the hook level; invocations of the other commands pass
through unchanged. Hosts without the hook fall back to model-parsed startup
via the shared [command-invocation.md](references/command-invocation.md)
contract.
Commands always announce resolved inputs, reject invalid startup configs before
doing work, and treat wall-clock budgets like `--max-total-runtime` as
best-effort.

### Which Command?

| Situation | Command |
|-----------|---------|
| Draft a Lean skeleton (skeleton by default) | `/lean4:draft` |
| Draft + prove interactively | `/lean4:formalize` |
| Filling sorries (interactive) | `/lean4:prove` |
| Filling sorries (unattended) | `/lean4:autoprove` |
| Save point (per-file + project build, best-effort axiom scan, commit) | `/lean4:checkpoint` |
| Quality check (read-only) | `/lean4:review` |
| Simplify proof strategies (mathlib leverage, helpers) | `/lean4:refactor` |
| Optimizing compiled proofs | `/lean4:golf` |
| New to this project / exploring | `/lean4:learn --mode=repo` |
| Navigating mathlib for a topic | `/lean4:learn --mode=mathlib` |
| Something not working | `/lean4:doctor` |
| Formalize + prove end-to-end (unattended) | `/lean4:autoformalize --source=... --claim-select=first --out=...` |

## Contributing (lean4-contribute plugin)

**If the `lean4-contribute` plugin is installed,** you may **suggest** these commands at natural stopping points. Rules:

- **Suggest first, never invoke unprompted.** Offer a one-line question; do not start the command flow.
- **Only invoke after explicit user opt-in** in the current conversation. Silence, topic change, or implicit frustration do not count as consent.
- **At most once per topic per session** unless the user engages.
- **Never mid-proof.** Wait for a natural stopping point.

| Situation | Suggest |
|-----------|---------|
| Problem appears to be in lean4-skills itself (wrong command behavior, contradictory docs, broken lint, bad guardrail, confusing plugin UX) — not ordinary Lean/mathlib/user-proof problems | "This looks like a lean4-skills bug. Want me to draft a bug report?" → `/lean4-contribute:bug-report` |
| User wants a workflow the plugin doesn't support, says a command should behave differently, or you must recommend awkward manual steps due to a missing feature | "This looks like a plugin workflow gap. Want me to draft a feature request?" → `/lean4-contribute:feature-request` |
| Result seems reusable beyond the current task: tactic-selection heuristic, mathlib search pattern, anti-pattern, documentation gap with a clear lesson — not one-off theorem facts or private repo details | "That seems reusable beyond this task. Want me to draft a shareable insight?" → `/lean4-contribute:share-insight` |

**If the plugin is not installed** and the user clearly hit a lean4-skills bug, workflow gap, or reusable insight (same criteria as above — not ordinary Lean/mathlib issues), you may offer the install hint once:

- At most once per session. Do not repeat if the user declined, ignored it, or moved on.
- Never mid-proof or during an active debugging loop.
- One short line, not a pitch: "If you want, install the `lean4-contribute` plugin and I can draft that report for you here." See the [lean4-contribute README](../../../../plugins/lean4-contribute/README.md#installation) for setup.

## Typical Workflow

```
┌─ Entry points (pick one) ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ /lean4:draft              Skeleton by default (--mode=attempt for shallow proof)   │
│ /lean4:formalize          Interactive: draft + guided proving                      │
│ /lean4:autoformalize      Autonomous: draft + autonomous proving                   │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
        ↓ (if sorries remain)
/lean4:prove / autoprove    Proof engines (sorry filling, no header edits)
        ↓
/lean4:refactor            Leverage mathlib, extract helpers (optional)
        ↓
/lean4:golf                Improve proofs (optional)
        ↓
/lean4:checkpoint          Save point (per-file + project build)
```

Use `/lean4:learn` at any point to explore repo structure or navigate mathlib. Three entry points: `/lean4:draft` for skeletons, `/lean4:formalize` for interactive synthesis (draft + guided proving), `/lean4:autoformalize` for unattended source-to-proof.

**Notes:**
- `/lean4:prove` asks before each cycle; `/lean4:autoprove` loops autonomously with explicit stop budgets
- Both trigger `/lean4:review` at configured intervals (`--review-every`)
- When reviews run (via `--review-every`), they act as gates: review → replan → continue. In prove, replan requires user approval; in autoprove, replan auto-continues
- Review supports `--mode=batch` (default) or `--mode=stuck` (triage); review is always read-only
- `/lean4:autoformalize` wraps draft+autoprove in a single command (source → claims → skeletons → proofs); replaces `autoprove --formalize=auto`
- Proof engines (`prove`/`autoprove`) never modify declaration headers (header fence)
- If you hit environment issues, run `/lean4:doctor` to diagnose

## LSP Tools (Preferred)

Sub-second feedback and search tools (LeanSearch, Loogle, LeanFinder) via Lean LSP MCP:

```
lean_goal(file, line)                           # See exact goal
lean_hover_info(file, line, col)                # Understand types
lean_local_search("keyword")                    # Fast local + mathlib (unlimited)
lean_leanfinder("goal or query")                # Semantic, goal-aware (10/30s)
lean_leansearch("natural language")             # Semantic search (3/30s)
lean_loogle("?a → ?b → _")                      # Type-pattern (unlimited if local mode)
lean_hammer_premise(file, line, col)            # Premise suggestions for simp/aesop/grind (3/30s)
lean_state_search(file, line, col)              # Goal-conditioned lemma search (3/30s)
lean_multi_attempt(file, line, snippets=[...])  # Test multiple tactics
lean_diagnostic_messages(file)                  # Per-file error/warning check
lean_code_actions(file, line)                   # Resolve "Try this" suggestions to edits
```

`lean_run_code` is for isolated scratch experiments, not a substitute for live proof-state inspection via `lean_goal`/`lean_multi_attempt`/`lean_diagnostic_messages`. Prefer live-file tools when the question depends on actual file context.

## Capabilities

| Capability | Required | Check | Fallback |
|-----------|----------|-------|----------|
| Lean / Lake | yes | `lean --version`, `lake --version` | none — run `/lean4:doctor` |
| Python 3 | yes (scripts) | `$LEAN4_PYTHON_BIN` set by bootstrap | none for script-dependent operations |
| `$LEAN4_SCRIPTS` | yes (set by bootstrap) | `echo "$LEAN4_SCRIPTS"` | run `/lean4:doctor` |
| Lean LSP MCP | no | try `lean_goal` on any `.lean` file | scripts + `lake env lean` (file-level only) |
| `lean_run_code` | no | try calling it | `lake env lean` on temp file |
| `lean_code_actions` | no | try calling it | manual "Try this" application |
| Subagent dispatch | no | host-dependent | run work in main thread |
| Slash commands | no | host-dependent | follow skill instructions directly |

## Operating Profiles

The skill adapts to what's available. Determine your profile by checking capabilities above, then follow the corresponding guidance.

### full (all capabilities)

MCP + subagents + commands. Full workflow with live goal inspection, tactic testing, and parallel subagent dispatch (requires disjoint owned-file sets per agent, or separate worktrees). Subagents get pre-collected MCP context per [cycle-engine.md § Pre-flight Context](references/cycle-engine.md#pre-flight-context-for-subagent-dispatch). If `lean_run_code` is unavailable, use `/tmp` scratch files with `lake env lean` for isolated experiments.

### mcp_main_only (MCP available, no subagent dispatch)

MCP works in the main thread. Run all proof work directly — do not delegate to subagents. All cycle-engine phases execute in-thread. If `lean_run_code` is unavailable, use `/tmp` scratch files with `lake env lean` for isolated experiments.

### scripts_only (no MCP, no subagents)

Use `$LEAN4_SCRIPTS` for search and `lake env lean` / `lake build` for validation. **Key limitations in this mode:**
- **No live goal inspection** — `lean_goal` is unavailable; you can read the file and check compilation output, but cannot see proof state at a specific line
- **No tactic testing** — `lean_multi_attempt` is unavailable; edits must be validated by compiling the file (`lake env lean`)
- **No real-time diagnostics** — `lean_diagnostic_messages` is unavailable; use `lake env lean <file>` (from project root) for compilation errors, but feedback is file-level, not line-level
- **Search is script-based** — `$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/smart_search.sh` replaces LSP search tools

This mode is functional for straightforward proofs but significantly slower and less precise than MCP-backed workflows.

### review_only (read-only, no edits)

Read proof state and assess quality. No edits, no commits, no subagent dispatch.

## File Handling Rules

**Scratch-work ladder** (in preference order):
1. Live file + MCP tools (`lean_goal`, `lean_multi_attempt`, `lean_diagnostic_messages`)
2. `lean_run_code` for isolated experiments
3. `/tmp` scratch files only when `lean_run_code` is unavailable and the experiment must not touch the live file
4. Never create scratch files in the repo root

**File inspection:** Use Read and Grep to view source files. Never write Python scripts, temp files, or use `cat` pipelines just to read lines from a file you already have access to.

**Staging:** Stage only files touched during the current session. Never use `git add -A` or broad glob patterns. Print the exact staged set before committing.

See [sorry-filling.md](references/sorry-filling.md) for the full scratch-work preference order.

## Core Primitives

| Script | Purpose | Output |
|--------|---------|--------|
| `sorry_analyzer.py` | Find sorries with context | text (default), json, markdown, summary |
| `check_axioms_inline.sh` | Best-effort axiom scan (top-level declarations) | text |
| `smart_search.sh` | Multi-source mathlib search | text |
| `find_golfable.py` | Detect optimization patterns | JSON |
| `find_usages.sh` | Find declaration usages | text |

**Usage:** Invoked by commands automatically. See [references/](references/) for details.

**Invocation contract:** Never run bare script names. Always use:
- Python: `${LEAN4_PYTHON_BIN:-python3} "$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/script.py" ...`
- Shell: `bash "$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/script.sh" ...`
- Report-only calls: add `--report-only` to `sorry_analyzer.py`, `check_axioms_inline.sh`, `unused_declarations.sh` — suppresses exit 1 on findings; real errors still exit 1. Do not use in gate commands like `/lean4:checkpoint`.
- Keep stderr visible for Lean scripts (no `/dev/null` redirection), so real errors are not hidden.

If `$LEAN4_SCRIPTS` is unset or missing, run `/lean4:doctor` and stay LSP-only until resolved.

## Automation

`/lean4:prove` and `/lean4:autoprove` handle most tasks:
- **prove** — guided, asks before each cycle. Ideal for interactive sessions.
- **autoprove** — autonomous, loops with explicit stop budgets. Ideal for unattended runs.

Both share the same cycle engine (plan → work → checkpoint → review → replan → continue/stop) and follow the [LSP-first protocol](references/cycle-engine.md#lsp-first-protocol): LSP tools are normative for discovery and search; script fallback only when LSP is unavailable or exhausted. Compiler-guided repair is escalation-only — not the first response to build errors. For complex proofs, they may delegate to internal workflows for deep sorry-filling (with snapshot, rollback, and scope budgets), proof repair, or axiom elimination. You don't invoke these directly.

## Skill-Only Behavior

When editing `.lean` files without invoking a command, the skill runs **one bounded pass**:
- Read the goal or error via `lean_goal`/`lean_diagnostic_messages`
- Search mathlib with up to 2 LSP tools (e.g. `lean_local_search` + `lean_leanfinder`/`lean_leansearch`/`lean_loogle`)
- Try the [Automation Tactics](#automation-tactics) cascade
- Validate with `lean_diagnostic_messages` (no project-gate `lake build` in this mode)
- No looping, no deep escalation, no multi-cycle behavior, no commits
- End with suggestions:
  > Use `/lean4:prove` for guided cycle-by-cycle help.
  > Use `/lean4:autoprove` for autonomous cycles with stop safeguards.

## Quality Gate

A proof is complete when:
- `lake build` passes
- Zero sorries in agreed scope
- Only standard axioms (`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`)
- No statement changes without permission

Verification ladder: `lean_diagnostic_messages(file)` per-edit → `lake env lean <path/to/File.lean>` file gate (run from project root) → `lake build` project gate only. See [cycle-engine: Build Target Policy](references/cycle-engine.md#build-target-policy).

## Common Fixes

See [compilation-errors](references/compilation-errors.md) for error-by-error guidance (type mismatch, unknown identifier, failed to synthesize, timeout, etc.).

## Type Class Patterns

```lean
-- Local instance for this proof block
haveI : MeasurableSpace Ω := inferInstance
letI : Fintype α := ⟨...⟩

-- Scoped instances (affects current section)
open scoped Topology MeasureTheory
```

Order matters: provide outer structures before inner ones.

## Automation Tactics

Try in order (stop on first success):
`rfl` → `simp` → `ring` → `linarith` → `nlinarith` → `omega` → `exact?` → `apply?` → `grind` → `aesop`

Note: `exact?`/`apply?` query mathlib (slow). `grind` and `aesop` are powerful but may timeout. See [grind-tactic](references/grind-tactic.md) for interactive workflows, annotation strategy, and simproc escalation.

## Troubleshooting

If LSP tools aren't responding, check your operating profile above. In `scripts_only` mode, `$LEAN4_SCRIPTS` provides search and `lake env lean` provides file-level compilation feedback, but live goal inspection, tactic testing, and line-level diagnostics are unavailable. If environment variables (`LEAN4_SCRIPTS`, `LEAN4_REFS`) are missing, run `/lean4:doctor` to diagnose.

**Script environment check:**
```bash
echo "$LEAN4_SCRIPTS"
ls -l "$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/sorry_analyzer.py"
# One-pass discovery for troubleshooting (human-readable default text):
${LEAN4_PYTHON_BIN:-python3} "$LEAN4_SCRIPTS/sorry_analyzer.py" . --report-only
# Structured output (optional): --format=json
# Counts only (optional): --format=summary
```

**Cold start / fresh worktree:**
- Fresh worktree or after `lake clean`? Prime the cache in that worktree before the first real build.
- Use the project's cache command: `lake cache get` on newer Lake, or `lake exe cache get` where the project still uses the mathlib cache executable.
- If Lean LSP is cold or timing out on first use, run one `lake build` to bootstrap the workspace.
- After bootstrap, return to the normal verification ladder:
  `lean_diagnostic_messages(file)` → `lake env lean <path/to/File.lean>` (from project root) → `lake build` only at checkpoint/final gate.
- Do **not** symlink another worktree's `.lake/build`; use Lake cache/artifact mechanisms instead.

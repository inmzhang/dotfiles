# Agent Workflow Examples

**Internal reference:** These workflows are orchestrated by commands. You typically don't invoke them directly.

**Review source** is chosen at prove/autoprove start. External review provides advice only—it cannot apply fixes directly.

### Helper Extraction Example

```
## Sorry Filling Plan

**Target:** Core.lean:156 - `filter_convergence`

**Why it's hard:**
- Need Filter.Eventually lemma but it doesn't exist yet
- Type class instance ordering issue
- Existing proof approach requires an intermediate bridging lemma

**Strategy:**
1. Extract helper lemma `filter_eventually_of_set` bridging Set and Filter
2. Add import for `Mathlib.Order.Filter.Basic`
3. Prove main theorem using helper
4. Verify dependent theorems still work

**Estimated difficulty:** medium
**Estimated phases:** 3

---

## Phase 1 Complete

**Actions taken:**
- Added `filter_eventually_of_set` helper lemma
- Added import for `Mathlib.Order.Filter.Basic`

**Compile status:** ✓ Success

**Next phase:** Fill original sorry using helper

---

## Phase 2 Complete

**Actions taken:**
- Filled sorry using helper lemma
- Proof: 4 lines using `filter_eventually_of_set` + `Filter.Eventually.mono`

**Compile status:** ✓ Success

---

## Sorry Filled Successfully

**Target:** Core.lean:156
**Strategy used:** helper extraction
**Phases completed:** 2
**Total edits:** 2 files changed

**Summary:**
- Sorry eliminated: ✓
- Proof type: helper-lemmas
- Complexity: 4 lines of proof
- New helpers introduced: 1 (`filter_eventually_of_set`)
- Axioms introduced: 0

**Verification:**
- File compiles: ✓
- Dependent theorems work: ✓
- No unexpected axioms: ✓

### Verified Inlining Example

```
File: Core.lean
Finding patterns...

Pattern found at line 45:
  let x := complex_expr
  have h := property x
  exact h

Running: $LEAN4_SCRIPTS/analyze_let_usage.py Core.lean --line 45
Result: x used 1 time, h used 1 time

Safety: ✓ Safe to inline (both used ≤2 times)

Before (3 lines):
  let x := complex_expr
  have h := property x
  exact h

After (1 line):
  exact property complex_expr

Building... ✓

Savings: 2 lines, ~30 tokens
```

### False Positive Detection

```
Pattern found at line 78:
  let bound := expensive_computation
  ...uses bound 6 times...

Running: $LEAN4_SCRIPTS/analyze_let_usage.py Core.lean --line 78
Result: bound used 6 times

Safety: ✗ SKIP - would expand code 6× (from 1 expr to 6)

Skipping this optimization.
```

### Saturation Report

```
Proof Golfing Results:

File: Core.lean
Patterns attempted: 15
Successful: 8
Failed/Reverted: 2
Skipped (safety): 5

Total savings:
- Lines: 145 → 127 (12% reduction)
- Tokens: estimated 2100 → 1850 tokens

Saturation indicators:
- Success rate: 8/15 = 53%
- Last 3 attempts: 1 success, 2 skips

Status: Good progress, some room remains.
Continue? (yes/no)
```

### LSP Lemma Replacement

```
Pattern found at line 30:
  exact custom_continuous_comp f g

LSP search: lean_local_search("continuous comp") → Continuous.comp
Replacement: lean_multi_attempt(file, 30, ["exact Continuous.comp f g"])
  Result: ✓ passes

Before (1 line):
  exact custom_continuous_comp f g

After (1 line + import):
  exact Continuous.comp f g

Diagnostics: lean_diagnostic_messages(file) → no errors
Import added: Mathlib.Topology.Basic

Savings: replaced custom helper with mathlib lemma
Handoff: not needed (single-line, no statement change)
```
